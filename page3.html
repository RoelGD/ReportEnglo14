      <H1>CAMPUS JOURNALISM ACT </H1>
      <p>The Campus Journalism Act, has a different basis for choosing the adviser.
        Selecting an adviser is also optional for the tertiarv level.
        For the traditional and beginning campus paper system in the DepEd, the principal
        or the head of the school, with the recommendation of the adviser may designate
        the members of the staff or may pick them through a competitive examination. The
        candidates should possess writing ability, leadership and previous experiences in school
        publication in such order. Whatever the criteria are in choosing the staff, the method
        should be systematic, objective and fair.</p>
        
        <p>Whether the editors and staff members are chosen through recommendation or
        competitive examination, the following pointers are recommended:</p>
        
        <dd>
        * The candidate should have at least one year residence.</br>
        * The candidate should not be in the probation list.</br>
        * He/she must not have any disciplinary case against him/her, because there is a
          likely chance for him to drop or to be suspended.
